## 🌱 What is RhythmOS?

RhythmOS is a rhythm-based behavior & self-guidance system built around emotional awareness, tone-adaptive language (CRE), and self-reflective growth feedback.

You don’t manage tasks here. You manage tone.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🌀 Language-based rhythm check-in (collapsed → rising)
- 💬 CRE engine: generate tone-matched motivational phrases
- ✍️ Journaling fallback system (for blocked/collapsed states)
- 🎯 Task path generation based on state × difficulty
